# List of recipes and roles to apply. Requires Chef 0.8, earlier versions use 'recipes()'.
run_list(
  "role[base]",
  "recipe[sphinx]",
)

# Attributes applied if the node doesn't have it set already.
default_attributes({
  'sphinx' => {
    'use_mysql'   => true,
    'use_package' => true
  }
})

# Attributes applied no matter what the node has set already.
